	<!-- Validation settings for project -->

<context id="jvpp0000">
<description>The project validation page allows you to view or change the validation settings for a project. A validator is a tool that checks that resources conform to a specification, DTD, or some other set of rules.

Each validator can apply to certain types of files, certain project natures, and certain project facets. When a validator applies to a project facet or nature, the workbench uses that validator only on projects that have that facet or nature. Likewise, most validators apply only to certain types of files, so the workbench uses those validators only on those types of files.

Select the <b>Override validation preferences</b> check box if you want to override the default validation preferences set in the workbench Preferences page. If the <b>Override validation preferences</b> check box is not enabled, go to <b>Window</b> &gt; <b>Preferences</b> &gt; <b>Validation</b> and select the <b>Allow projects to override these preference settings</b> check box.

Select the <b>Suspend all validators</b> check box to prevent validation for this project.

In the list of validators, select the check boxes next to each validator you want to use for this project. Each validator has a check box to specify whether it is used on manual validation or on build validation. Choose an alternate implementation for a validator or change it's detailed settings by clicking the button in the <b>Settings</b> column. Not all validators have detailed settings.

<description>The New Filter Rule dialog adds a new rule to either an Include Group or an Exclude Group. There are several types of rules:

<b>File extension</b> - A rule that is only concerned with matching file extensions, for example html for HTML files or xml for XML files.

<b>Folder or file name</b> - A rule for matching folder or file names. These names are relative to a project.

<b>Content Type</b> - The next page will show a drop down list of all the known content types. Content types are more powerful than file extensions, but also slower to match at runtime.

#     * Code oriented instructions:
#     *
#     * In the string, you may see the following special sequences:
#     * a) {n}  where n is a number. These are replaceable parameters.
#     * b) ''  In .properties files, in order to see one apostrophe (') in the final
#     *    string, sometimes two apostrophes must be entered in the string. In the translated
#     *    string, if there is at least one {n} in the string, then to show one apostrophe
#     *    to the user, put two apostrophes in the string. If there are no {n} in the string,
#     *    then put one apostrophe.
#     *    For example, say that you want the user to read "George's file". 
#     *        GEORGE=George's file was on the desk.
#     *        GEORGE2=George''s file and {0} were on the desk.
#     *    GEORGE uses one apostrophe because there are no {n} and GEORGE2
#     *    uses two apostrophes because there is a {n}.
#     * c) '' text '' where text can be any word(s). The text between the double
#     *    apostrophes should not be translated. 
#     * d) <text> where text can be any word(s). The text between the angle
#     *    brackets should NOT be translated.
#     * e) "text" where text can be any word(s). The text between the quotation 
#     *    marks should NOT be translated.
#     *    
#     *************************************************************************
#     * Other instructions
#     * a) Do not translate any text that is on a line which begins with a comment 
#     *    symbol (#).
#     * b) Do not translate these words: 
#     *        schema, EJB, RDB, JAR, RMI, BMP, CMP, OOSQL
#     * c) Please return the .properties files using the same directory structure.
#     *    This is necessary because two of the files have the same name.
#     *

 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When there is a need to search a document that has some mixed content, then
 * using a one participant will not be enough. E.g. for the searching of the JSP
 * content, a JSP participant needs to create {@link SearchDocument} that
 * contain Java compilation unit and then pass it to the default Java search
 * participant of the Java Search Engine. The same with XML: when there is an
 * XML content that default search participant could not process, but it is
 * required to be search on, a new search participant needs to be defined. That
 * search participant would know how create search document from the content and
 * then it can call default XML search participant.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Passing its own {@link SearchRequestor} this participant can then map the
 * match positions back to the original contents, create its own matches and
 * report them to the original requestor.

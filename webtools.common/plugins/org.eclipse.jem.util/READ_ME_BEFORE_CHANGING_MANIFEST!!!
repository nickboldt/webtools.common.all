Do not include a new dependency plugin to the MANIFEST for this plugind!!!

The reason for this is that this plugin is also executed outside of Eclipse framework, such IBM Websphere Application Server (c) IBM. We cannot add
new dependencies to the plugin because the current set is considered to be API. Adding a new set without consulting those users would break
them.

The external API is anything in the jemutil-nonworkbench folder. If it is only for a class in the other source folder(s) it may be OK since they would not be 
using that code. But it would be best to consult with them first.

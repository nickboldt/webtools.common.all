This is a stub plugin for perfmsr. It is here just so that org.eclipse.jem.util can compile.

It should not be an open project during normal usage. Whenever any of the files in this project
are changed, "perfmsr.jardesc" should be used to create the new changed appropriate jar, and then that
jar should be imported into the org.eclipse.jem.util project. After that is done this project
should be closed or deleted (after the changes have been committed to CVS).
